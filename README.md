# us-ellection-auto-call
US election result - Automated call

I need to go to sleep so I made this script to know the result through a automated phone call.

# First things first:
- Go to https://twilio.com
- Login or create a new account
- You can find your SID and TOKEN in the dashboard
- Create a twilio number and paste it here

# How to run it:
- `pip install twilio`
- `python us-ellection-auto-call.py`
